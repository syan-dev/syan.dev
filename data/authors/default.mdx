Hi, I'm Sy An, a passionate developer and maker with a unique journey. Growing up in a mountainous province in Vietnam, I did not have access to the internet until my 20s.

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree at Université Grenoble Alpes while working on my side hustle: building platforms that help people start and maintain their workout routines. Fitness, especially calisthenics, is a significant part of my life, and I aim to inspire others to stay active and healthy.

I hold an Engineering degree from Hanoi University of Science and Technology and have gained valuable experience working with innovative startups like BKAI Lab, VinAI, and akaBot. I've had the opportunity to be involved in the publication of two AI papers and the granting of a US patent, which I'm grateful for.

One of my proudest achievements is winning four scholarships, which have enabled me to explore the world and seize every opportunity that comes my way. Coming from a background with limited resources, I hadn't had many chances to travel. These experiences have been invaluable, broadening my understanding of different cultures and ideas.
